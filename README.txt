Hello! 

Welcome to my Sarah the Zombie Barman Simulation!! 

When developing my metric code, I configured my program to the OS2_Assignment2025_barSim\OS2_Assignment2025_barSim
directory. Please run the project in the appropriate folder or the test_results/final_barmanMetricsLogger.csv won't work.
This also applies for the make run ARGS = “30 2 5 30” command and shell script. 


Thank you!
